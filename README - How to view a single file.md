## How to view a single file

To view your specific file, Hit run and the index.php page will run. On the far top-right side of the preview window, you can select the little box with an arrow or navigate to this page âžœ https://is4460finalproject.conmans11.repl.co/ in your address bar. 

From here, simply put in the path to your file after the URL. For instance, to get to the account_view.php page, you need to navigate to https://is4460finalproject.conmans11.repl.co/src/app/account_view.php.
